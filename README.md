SNHU-CS230-Module Eight Journal: Portfolio Submission
Student: Chris Williford
Instructor: Tracy Lanham

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Chat Away is a social media company that has a successful website and is now seeking to develop a mobile app. To market their product to a larger customer base and increase revenue, they are looking to create a mobile app that is used for iPhone and Android smartphones that will be made available to both users in the app stores.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
My instructor expressed that I did really well when developing and expressing the evaluations sections of the documentation, even though there were a few erros here and there.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I tend to overdocument to ensure that I am not leaving out any necessary details. This was avoided by ensuring all requirements were met without over complicating things.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to choose one to revise, it would have to be Memory and Storage Management. I forgot to cite resources and use references to provide support for my ideas and conclusions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I took the functionality of the game and split it up so that there would be less work and time spent expanding it to other operating platforms. If the client(s) do not trust the software or have issues with it, then they will more than likely not use the program or product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I utilized agile methodologies, focusing on iterative development and regular feedback loops. In the future, I would incorporate more prototyping and user testing early in the design phase to refine features based on real user interactions.
